        <h2>The Global Water Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          In many communities around the world, clean water is still a luxury. 
          <strong>771 million people</strong> lack access to safe drinking water, leading to 
          preventable illnesses and lost opportunities. Women and children often spend 
          hours every day walking to collect water, missing school and work in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charity: water is changing this reality. As a nonprofit <em>dedicated to ending the water crisis</em>, 
          we fund sustainable water projects in developing communities – from drilled wells to rainwater catchments. 
          Every project is powered by your voice and action, and when a community gains access to clean water, 
          health improves, kids can attend school, and women can invest time in their families and livelihoods. 
          It’s a transformation that proves your passion can create lasting impact.
